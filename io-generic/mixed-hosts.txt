# Mixed Hosts Configuration File
# This file contains both OpenShift VMs and bare metal servers for auto-detection testing
# Lines starting with # are comments and will be ignored
# The script will automatically detect which hosts are VMs (use virtctl) vs bare metal (use SSH)
# 
# NEW FEATURE: You can now use host patterns in this file!
# Patterns like vm-{1..5} will be automatically expanded to vm-1, vm-2, vm-3, vm-4, vm-5

# OpenShift Virtual Machines (will be accessed via virtctl ssh)
# Use patterns for efficient configuration of multiple VMs
vm-{1..5}
worker-{1..3}
app-server-{1..2}

# Bare Metal Servers (will be accessed via direct SSH)
# You can use patterns for bare metal servers too, or list them individually
fed{1..3}
baremetal-server-{1..2}
storage-node-{1..2}

# Individual hosts (for special cases)

# Example patterns you can use:
# vm-{1..10}        # vm-1, vm-2, ..., vm-10
# server-{001..050} # server-001, server-002, ..., server-050 (zero-padded)
# worker-{1..5}     # worker-1, worker-2, worker-3, worker-4, worker-5
# test-{a..c}       # test-a, test-b, test-c (letter ranges)
