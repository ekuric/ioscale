# MariaDB HammerDB TPCC Testing Configuration
# This YAML file configures all aspects of the MariaDB performance testing script

# Storage Configuration
storage:
  # Either mount_point or disk_list must be specified (set unused one to null)
  mount_point: null               # Mount point to use for MariaDB data (e.g., "/perf1") - this mount point is used for data storage and must be present on the test machine.
  disk_list: "/dev/vdc"          # Block device to use for MariaDB data (e.g., "/dev/vdc")

# Database Configuration
database:
  # Method 1: Simple list (for small numbers)
  hosts: "vm1"                   # Space-separated list of VM hostnames - eg "vm1 vm2 vm3"
  
  # Method 2: Host range expansion (for large numbers)
  # host_pattern: "db{1..200}"     # Bash-style range expansion: db1, db2, ..., db200
  # host_pattern: "mariadb-{001..050}"  # Zero-padded: mariadb-001, mariadb-002, ..., mariadb-050
  
  # Method 3: Label-based selection (dynamic discovery)
  # host_labels: "app=mariadb-test"                # Select VMs with label app=mariadb-test
  # host_labels: "env=performance,tier=database"   # Multiple labels (AND condition)
  
  # Method 4: External host file
  # host_file: "/path/to/mariadb-hosts.txt"        # File with one hostname per line
  
  namespace: "default"           # Kubernetes namespace for VMs
  warehouse_count: 50            # Number of warehouses for TPCC test
  test_duration: 15              # Test duration in minutes

# Test Configuration
test:
  user_count: "1"               # Space-separated list of user counts to test, eg "1 2 4 8"
  run_name: "HDB_MDB"           # Base name for test runs
  storage_type: "null"          # Storage type identifier for reporting
  log_level: "INFO"             # Logging level (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR)

# HammerDB Configuration
hammerdb:
  repo: "https://github.com/ekuric/fusion-access.git"  # Git repository URL
  path: "/root/hammerdb-tpcc-wrapper-scripts"          # Scripts directory path
  install_dir: "/usr/local/HammerDB"                   # HammerDB installation directory

# Example configurations for different environments
# Uncomment and modify as needed

# Development Environment (smaller scale, faster tests)
# storage:
#   disk_list: "/dev/vdb"
# database:
#   hosts: "dev-vm1"
#   warehouse_count: 10
#   test_duration: 5
# test:
#   user_count: "1 2"

# Production Environment (large scale, comprehensive tests)
# storage:
#   mount_point: "/perf1"
# database:
#   hosts: "prod-vm1 prod-vm2 prod-vm3"
#   warehouse_count: 500
#   test_duration: 60
# test:
#   user_count: "50 100 200"

# Large Scale Examples (100+ VMs):

# 200 VMs with pattern expansion
# storage:
#   mount_point: "/perf1"
# database:
#   host_pattern: "mariadb-{001..200}"
#   namespace: "database-testing"
#   warehouse_count: 1000
#   test_duration: 120
# test:
#   user_count: "100 200 500"

# Dynamic selection based on labels
# storage:
#   disk_list: "/dev/vdc"
# database:
#   host_labels: "workload=mariadb-performance,env=production"
#   namespace: "production"
#   warehouse_count: 500
#   test_duration: 180
# test:
#   user_count: "50 100 200 400"

# Multi-environment testing with external host file
# storage:
#   mount_point: "/data"
# database:
#   host_file: "/etc/testing/mariadb-production-vms.txt"
#   namespace: "multi-env"
#   warehouse_count: 750
#   test_duration: 240
# test:
#   user_count: "25 50 100 200 300"

# CI/CD Environment (minimal tests for validation)
# storage:
#   disk_list: "/dev/vdc"
# database:
#   hosts: "ci-vm1"
#   warehouse_count: 5
#   test_duration: 2
# test:
#   user_count: "1"
